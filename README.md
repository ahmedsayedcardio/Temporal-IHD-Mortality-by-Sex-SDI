This repository contains the code required to reproduce an analysis of temporal trends in IHD mortality according to the socioeconomic development index (SDI) stratified by sex. 
The "Analysis" file contains the statistical code. The "Results" file contains the markdown code.

Please note that the mortality data required for this analysis can be obtained from the GBD https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/. Data on socioedemographic indices can be obtained from here: https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2021-gbd-2021-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1950%E2%80%932021. Some of the countries/territories do not have identical naming in the two files. Therefore, I have created a "Naming Differences Between the Mortality and the SDI Files" file to remedy this (it is uploaded to this repository and is used by the R code in the Quarto Analysis file).

I would be happy to answer any inquiries you have about the underlying code at the following email address: asu.ahmed.sayed@gmail.com
